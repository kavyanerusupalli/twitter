SETUP
You will be given one week to submit your response to this question.
Plan to spend 2-3 hours to complete.

SUBMISSION
Please run 'mvn clean install' which will zip up your source code and save it
at './target/tweet-log-template-2.0.0-SNAPSHOT-src.zip'.  Email this .zip to your recruiter.
We expect to be able to run 'mvn clean install' on your submission using
Maven 3.4+ and Java8 and have the code compile and the tests pass.
Please include your name somewhere in the source code.

WHAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR
Please write a production ready library that your fellow engineers would use.
Please submit clean, tested and performant Java code that makes efficient use of memory and CPU.
You may create additional Java packages, files, classes, tests, and test input files.
Organize these files as you see fit and take your time to submit your best work.
We are looking at the quality of your code, not how quickly you respond.

QUESTION
At Twitter, we have a log indicating which Tweets our users view.
The log consists of a user name and a Tweet id(comma separated).
Three Tweets viewed in a row by a user is a Tweet view path.
We are looking for the Tweet view path(s) that occurs the most.

Can you help the Data and Enterprise Solutions team by building a library that can read this log and return the data we need?

NOTES
If there are multiple Tweet view paths that are viewed the most, return all of them.
Fail fast if you encounter malformed data in the log.

SAMPLES
Sample log files with expected answers are provided under src/test/resources/samples.
